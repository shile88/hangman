# Hangman Game Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description

Hangman is a simple word guessing game(hidden word is in English). Players try to figure out an unknown word by guessing letters. If too many letters which do not appear in the word are guessed, the player is hanged (and loses).

The benefit of this program is primarily that it allows someone to play as a solitaire game without requiring another person to participate.

## Project Features:

- Game : Contains main logic of the game (generates random words, displays wrong guesses, displays did you win or lose, gives option to play again)
- HangmanPicture : Used for displaying pictures depending on number of guesses
- Words : Used for displaying words and correctly guessed letters

## Build with

- HTML 
- CSS (pure CSS no libraries used)
- JS 
- ReactJS (requries axios for fetching random words from public API)
